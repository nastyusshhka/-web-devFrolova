        <div class="item"><b>1. Explain “repaint” and “reflow” of the webpage</b>
            <p>Answer: <i>Repaint</i> is about updating the appearance, when something changes visually (like color or text), the browser needs to repaint that part of the page. <i>Reflow</i> is when elements on a web page change position or size, the browser needs to recalculate where everything goes. This can happen when you add or remove elements, change styles, or resize the window.

            <p>Answer: When the browser loads JavaScript files, it can slow down the page loading speed, especially if the JavaScript files are large or a lot, JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the page, which can also slow down the loading process. To improve site loading, you can use loading attribute, minify and compress JavaScript code.
